This is the capstone project of the SQL module of the Data Analytics I have been taking for the past months.

The project was done in DataGrip using MySQL and it followed the instructions that have been added as comments to the SQL code (see attached SQL file for more).

Starting with simple queries, the project quickly required the use of somewhat complex SQL queries, but the real challenge was determining, how to use JOIN between the various tables in the database, to obtain the required information. The schema does not include information on how the tables relate to eachother, but in practically all cases, they have 1-n relationships.

Since this project was part of a course, it puts greater emphasis on the technical aspect of SQL. The final step was saving the results in a new table in the DB and renaming one of its columns.
